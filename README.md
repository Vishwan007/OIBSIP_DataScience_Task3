# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task3

Goal: The main goal of this task is to predict the car prices from its provided attributes such as car_name, year, kilometers driven etc.

Tools Used: Here I used the Google colab platform to implement these task and the coding language is python using libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib for graphs.

Models : Used models such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression.

Evaluation: Used metrics like r2 score, mean squared error to measure the performance.

workflow: Initially we started with the collection of dataset and convert the dataset into the format of a data frame using the pandas inbuilt library of python. In this project I used seaborn and matplotlib to plot the graphs that helps us to understand about the dataset in a visual manner. After this I splitted the data into the training as well as testing dataset. Here in this task we use the regression models as we need to find the accurate value of the car selling price. I used the linear and logistic regression models to check which model performs better on the basis of the mean squared error and R squared error, As I got the Linear Regression accuracy as 86% so I used this model to obtain the accurate result.
